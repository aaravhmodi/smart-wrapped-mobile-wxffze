You want to build a Spotify Wrapped Mobile app using React Native and Expo, focusing on providing users with listening insights, personalized recommendations, and playlist cleanup suggestions. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Spotify OAuth Login:** Implement a secure login flow using WebView and a PHP backend to handle token exchange.\n*   **Wrapped Dashboard:** Display top artists, genres, and listening trends based on fetched data.\n*   **Smart Insights Engine:** Analyze skip rate, replay patterns, and listening consistency to generate personalized insights.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#121212` (Dark gray, similar to Spotify's dark mode)\n    *   Text: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#B3B3B3` (Light gray)\n    *   Primary: `#1DB954` (Spotify green)\n    *   Secondary: `#282828` (Slightly lighter dark gray for cards)\n    *   Accent: `#FFA500` (Orange, for highlights and recommendations)\n    *   Card: `#1E1E1E` (Darker gray for card backgrounds)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFFFFF` (White, for emphasis)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for each platform) or \"Roboto\" for Android and \"San Francisco\" for iOS.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Backend Setup (PHP):** This part is outside the scope of the React Native app itself, but it's crucial. You'll need PHP scripts for:\n    *   `callback.php`: Handles the Spotify OAuth callback and exchanges the code for tokens.\n    *   `refresh.php`: Refreshes the access token when it expires.\n2.  **Implement Spotify OAuth Login:**\n    *   Modify the app to include a login button that redirects users to Spotify's authorization page.\n    *   Handle the deep link (`spotifywrapped://callback?...`) to receive the tokens from the backend.\n    *   Store the tokens securely using `AsyncStorage`.\n3.  **Create Wrapped Dashboard:**\n    *   Create a new component called `WrappedDashboard`.\n    *   Fetch data from Spotify endpoints (`/me`, `/me/player`, `/me/top`) using the access token.\n    *   Display top artists, genres, and listening trends in a visually appealing way (consider using cards and charts).\n4.  **Implement Smart Insights Engine:**\n    *   Create a service or utility function to analyze listening data.\n    *   Detect skip rate, replay patterns, and listening consistency.\n    *   Generate personalized insights based on the analysis (e.g., \"You skipped 30% of tracks in 'Chill Vibes'\").\n5.  **Integrate UI elements:**\n    *   Modify the app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx file to integrate the WrappedDashboard component.\n    *   Modify the app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx to make the WrappedDashboard component visible in the app.\n\nNow, I'll provide instructions for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n**Instructions for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  Create a new component called `WrappedDashboard` in the `components` directory.\n2.  Implement the Spotify OAuth login flow in the `WrappedDashboard` component.\n3.  Fetch data from Spotify endpoints (`/me`, `/me/player`, `/me/top`) using the access token.\n4.  Display top artists, genres, and listening trends in the `WrappedDashboard` component using the colors and typography specified above.\n5.  Implement the Smart Insights Engine in a service or utility function.\n6.  Detect skip rate, replay patterns, and listening consistency.\n7.  Generate personalized insights based on the analysis.\n8.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to integrate the `WrappedDashboard` component.\n9.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to make the `WrappedDashboard` component visible in the app.\n10. Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T01:54:58.119781"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Spotify Wrapped Mobile app!
